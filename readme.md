## TODOs

* [ ] Particles builder page to experiment and get example snippet
* [ ] Transform feedback particles for YES particles
* [ ] Events
   - Done emitting?
   - how do you know when you need to reclaim a particle
* [ ] Support arbitrary sprites
* [ ] Support animation?
* [ ] Collisions? Perhaps simple masking could work? Like for walls and junk
